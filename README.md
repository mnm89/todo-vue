# Todo List App
Below is a simple example of a To-Do List App built with Vue.js. This example demonstrates the basics of Vue.js, including components, data binding, event handling, and dynamic updates.

## Project Structure

```
/todo-app
  ├── index.html
  └── app.js
```

## key Features of the Code

1. **Vue.js Basics**:
   - The `data` object holds the state of the app, including the list of to-dos and the new to-do text.
   - The `methods` object contains functions for adding, toggling, and removing to-dos.

2. **Dynamic Updates**:
   - Vue.js automatically updates the DOM whenever the state changes, providing a reactive user experience.
   - The `v-model` directive binds the input field to the `newTodo` data property, making it reactive.

3. **Event Handling**:
   - The `@keyup.enter` and `@click` directives are used to handle user events like pressing the Enter key or clicking the Add button.

4. **Conditional Classes**:
   - The `:class` binding is used to dynamically add a class (`completed`) to a to-do item if it is marked as completed.

5. **Simple Styling**:
   - The app has a basic, clean design using embedded CSS. This can be expanded or customized as needed.

## TODO
  This simple Vue.js To-Do List App is a great starting point for learning how to build interactive applications with Vue.js. You can extend it with more features like local storage, editing tasks, filtering tasks, etc.
